# are accessible to the authenticated user.  As these may change, or may be friendship
# dependent, you must create your own entities and enter their ids below.  If an entity
# is left as IGNORE, the dependent unit test will be skipped
test.venue1.id=IGNORE
test.venue2.id=IGNORE
test.tip.id=IGNORE
# The special must be running at venue1
test.special.id=IGNORE
test.user.id=IGNORE
test.self.id=IGNORE

### Merchant API Testing Entities

# user has rights to manage.
